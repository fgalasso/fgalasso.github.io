					<h3>Label Propagation in Video Sequences</h3>

					<div class="someresearchdescription">

<p>Pixelwise labelled video sequences are essential for
learning multi-class classifiers for video segmentation or scene recognition. However hand labelling
video sequences frame-by-frame is tedious, time consuming (30
to 45 mins per frame) and it is difficult to maintain frame-to-frame label
consistency.</p>

<p>Label propagation in video sequences</p>
						</div>

<p>We<span class="white">_</span>formulate the problem as follows: given few hand-labelled frames
of a video sequence, (typically the first
and last frames), we aim at providing pixelwise labelling of all other frames of the video
sequence along with the class probabilities.</p>

<p>A sample result of label propagation obtained by using our probabilistic model.
The proposed methods based on image
patches and semantic regions are superior to a naive solution based on optical flow</p>
						</div>

<p>Our <em>novel probabilistic model<span class="white">_</span>and inference algorithm</em> can be
based<span class="white">_</span>on pixelwise correspondences
obtained<span class="white">_</span>with a variety of<span class="white">_</span>methods. We have<span class="white">_</span>compared qualitatively and quantitatively the label
propagation results given by using <em>optic flow estimates</em>, alongside
more sophisticated approaches based on <em>image patches</em>,
as seen in epitomic models, or extraction of <em>semantically consistent regions</em>.</p>

<p>We have used the propagated labels to train a state of
the art Random forest classifier for video segmentation. Compared with
training on fully ground truthed data, the classification results demonstrate
a minimal loss in accuracy, which supports and encourages the use of the proposed label
propagation algorithm.</p>

					<h3>3D shape reconstruction from homogeneous textures</h3>

					<div class="someresearchdescription">
<p>Shape-From-Texture is the area of Computer Vision which studies the recovery
of the shape of a textured object or scene.</p>

						</div>
<p>Psychological studies show that texture is important in the perception of
shape. Moreover it is ubiquitous.</p>
<p>However, the task is ill-posed for a machine and some initial assumption
is always necessary to identify the characteristic of the texture
conveying the shape information.</p>

<p>New unpublished result. A sunflower field and the side view of the reconstructed surface.
Normals are recovered locally at each pixel location</p>
						</div>
<p>We assume the most general <em>stochastic homogeneity</em> -
the generating process is stationary under translation -
which allows to consider many natural textures.</p>
<p>Given the initial assumptions, Shape-From-Texture is generally seen as
two distinct problems: the estimation of the texture distortion, due
to the geometry of the scene and the projection from the 3D world to
the 2D image; and the 3D shape reconstruction, given by interpreting
the measured distortion. We have contributed
to both these aspects.</p>

The reconstructed sequence is fluid and captures the small variations over time,
although the normals are estimated locally and each frame is processed independently.

						</div>
<p>In<span class="white">_</span>particular, the distortion information is characterized by the use of
<em>local spatial frequencies</em>. A novel method is introduced which combines
Fourier analysis and the use of Gabor functions to recover all the main
instantaneous frequencies of the texture at each pixel.</p>
<p>The 3D reconstruction
from the multi-scale distortion is then solved at different levels
of complexity: simple planar surfaces, general surfaces with
the frontal appearance of the texture available, general surfaces
where no further assumption is needed, both in orthographic and perspective views.</p>
<p>Accuracy and robustness are demostrated in all cases. Most importantly
the model applies to complex natural textures.</p>
